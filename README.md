## Overview
An API to store benefit cards from companies to employees and log transactions.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
### Make sure you have the following tools installed before you begin:
<p>
	<a href="https://git-scm.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white"/></a>
	<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white"/></a>
	<a href="https://nodejs.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white"/></a>
	<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white"/></a>
</p>
<p>Not needed but recommended: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></p>


Use a terminal interface such as bash or zsh, and enter the following:
```bash
#download
gh repo clone fMagVen/Valex

#access the folder you downloaded it to
cd valex

#install dependencies
npm i

#install the db
bash /database/create-database
```
The app will run locally and you must configure a ```.env``` file with a port of your choosing. The default one is 5000.

## :gear:Running
```bash
#you can run the server with
npm run dev
```
In another terminal instance, run the db
```bash
#you can start the db running the script 
bash /database/connect-database

#in case you need to reset the data, run
bash /database/destroy-database
#then rerun the create-database script
```

### All requests are HTTP based

#### ```POST /cards/new```

Add new card to employee. Send header 'x-api-key' with value of the desined API Key of the company and body JSON with the following:

{

	type: string, one of the following: 'groceries', 'restaurants', 'transport', 'education', 'health'
	cpf: cpf of employee, string containing only numbers

}

Employees can only have one card of each type. A successful request will create and return the created card data. It is important to store the information safely, as some sensitive data will be stored encrypted and will not be possible to be retrieved later, in case of loss the lost card will have to be deleted and a new card created.

#### ```POST /cards/activate```

Activate a card. Card must already be created by the company.

{

	cardNumber: card number, as a string, returned upon card creation
	cvc: 3 digit numerical security code, as a string, also returned upon card creation
	newPassword: 4 digit numerical string

}

#### ```POST /cards/transactions```

Get all transactions of a card. Send request with:

{

	cardNumber: same as above
	cvc: same as above

}

The returned JSON will be:

{

	balance: total card balance,
	transactions: array of objects containing all payments, keys are:
		id: transaction id
		cardId: card id
		businessId: id of business balance was spent
		businessName: name of business
		timestamp: date in format DD/MM/YYYY
		amount: amount spent
	recharges: array of objects containing all recharges the card received, keys are:
		id: recharge id
		cardId: same as above
		timestamp: same as above
		amount: amount deposited as credit in card

}

#### ```POST /cards/recharge```

This endpoint allows the company the employee works in to recharge their card, send the API header with:

{

	type: type of card,
	cpf: cpf of employee,
	amount: amount to be deposited

}

#### ```POST /cards/block```

Blocks and unblocks a card. Send request with:

{

	cardNumber,
	cvc,
	password: 4 digit string set upon card activation

}

The API will reply with a JSON informing the state of the block situation of the card as:

{

	isBlocked: boolean

}

#### ```POST /buy```

Make a purchase from a business. Send a request with the following:

{

	cardNumber,
	password,
	businessName,
	amount: amount to be spent

}

The purchase can only be completed if the card has enough balance

#### ```POST /online```

Same idea, to buy something, but now online. Request:

	expirationDate: expiration date of card
	businessName,
	amount

}

All data must match. Purchase only to be completed if card has enough balance.
